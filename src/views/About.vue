    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Blood donation is a voluntary procedure that can help save the lives of others. There are several types of blood donation, which help meet different medical needs.</p>
    <h3>Whole blood donation</h3>
    <p>This is the most common type of blood donation, during which you donate about a pint of whole blood. The blood is then separated into its components — red cells, plasma, platelets.</p>
    <h3>Apheresis</h3>
    <p>During apheresis, you are hooked up to a machine that can collect and separate blood components, including red cells, plasma, platelets, and return unused components back to the donor.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Platelet donation (plateletpheresis)</b> collects only platelets — the cells that help stop bleeding by clumping and forming plugs (clotting) in blood vessels. <br>Donated platelets are commonly given to people with leukemia, people receiving chemotherapy and babies with severe infections.</li>
      <li><b>Double red cell</b> donation allows you to donate twice the amount of red blood cells than you normally would during a whole blood donation. Red blood cells deliver oxygen to the entire body.<br>People with a medical need for only red blood cells include those with severe blood loss, such as after an injury or accident, and those who have anemia with serious symptoms</li>
      <li><b>Plasma donation (plasmapheresis)</b> collects the liquid portion of the blood (plasma). Plasma helps blood clot and contains proteins and other substances, such as electrolytes, that help the body function normally.<br>Plasma is commonly given to people with liver conditions, burns and severe bacterial infections in their blood.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Why it's done</h3>
    <p>You agree to have blood drawn so that it can be given to someone who needs a blood transfusion.</p>
    <p>Millions of people need blood transfusions each year. Some may need blood during surgery. Others depend on it after an accident or because they have a disease that requires blood components. Blood donation makes all of this possible. There is no substitute for human blood — all transfusions use blood from a donor.</p>
    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <p>Blood donation is safe. New, sterile disposable equipment is used for each donor, so there's no risk of contracting a bloodborne infection by donating blood.</p>
    <p>If you're a healthy adult, you can usually donate a pint of blood without endangering your health. Within 24 hours of a blood donation, your body replaces the lost fluids. And after several weeks, your body replaces the lost red blood cells.</p>
    <h3>How you prepare <small class="d-block">Eligibility requirements</small></h3>
    <p>To be eligible to donate whole blood, plasma or platelets, you must be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In good health.</li>
      <li>At least 16 or 17 years old, depending on the law in your state. Some states allow legal minors to donate with parent permission. While there's no legal upper age limit, policies may vary between individual donor centers.</li>
      <li>At least 110 pounds.</li>
      <li>Able to pass the physical and health-history assessments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Eligibility requirements differ slightly between different types of blood donation, and from center to center. Check with your local donor center for specifics.</p>
